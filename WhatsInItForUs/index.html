									<Br> "We want to help budding and established music producers of the four four genres get where they deserve to be. We have created a platform from which we can feature and help promote the House and Techno artists we love. This is a big thing for us. As producers we know how difficult it can be to get music released and discovered. We provide a platform where artists and music fans can easily find and discover all things House and Techno while also learning more about the creators behind the music. We want to see more artists succeed and be part of their success."  </p>
