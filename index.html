With lots in the pipeline already for the year ahead nobody can argue that Duvz is carving his pathway into the scene right now through sheer talent, self-belief and hard work.

'Kate Bush' stars 'Hannah Mamalis', an Irish comedian and a member of the 'Dream Gun' comedy troupe who gives us a performance that suits the strange video premise fittingly.

												<h3> ARTIST SERIES 002 // 'Patrick Dandoczi'</h3>
												<p> With roots in both Ireland and Romania Patrick Dandoczi is a music producer who certainly offers his own unique perspective, style and sound on Techno. Dandoczi's tight production style gives his tracks a slightly more modern edge - an edge that many even seasoned producers struggle to achieve on a consistent basis. Everything about this guys music screams the word 'tight' - his mixing ability in the studio is next none and he has most definitely trained his ears at picking out ... <b> Read More </b> </p>

											<h3> ARTIST SERIES 001 // 'Cerillo' </h3>
											<p> I always had a huge interest in dance music and DJ’ing from a very young age, my Dad was a Club DJ during my younger years so that influence was always there. I learnt how to play first on old basic rack mounted CD players then I bought cheap Turntables, then better ones (because I couldn't afford CDJ’s and then realised I couldn't afford Vinyl haha) and eventually I moved back to CDJ’s. From there I wanted to take it further and learn how to make the music I was playing. I took a course in 2008 in Temple Bar Music Centre with Timmy Gibson and Tommy Conway who were excellent, but I gave up soon after because we learnt on Reason which wasn’t really for me.
												Fast forward 3 years and a friend of mine showed me Ableton. Everything I had learned previously clicked straight away and I couldn't believe how easy... <b> Read More </b> </p>

														<h3> THE IRISH NIGHTCLUB SCENE - EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW </h3>														
														<p> Opening a nightclub within Ireland although an exciting venture comes with a lot of work and is by no means an easy feat to achieve. With numerous rules, laws and regulations much must be considered before opening doors to the public. Currently the hottest issue of all within the nightclub industry and community of Ireland is the topic of opening hours and licensing. Irish nightclub opening hours are significantly shorter than that of our European cousins. Our licensing laws and closing times are proving it to be difficult and expensive to operate as a nightclub. Current licensing fees at €410 for every late night of opening are crippling... <b> Read More </b>  </p>
