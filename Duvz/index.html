												<BR>	"Soma being my favourite record label, so to win the competition they ran this time last year was just incredible really." 
												<BR><BR> From winning 'Soma' producer competition to playing his festival debut at 'Flame Festival' and a whole lot more - 2019 was a memorable year for Duvz to say the least. With lots in the pipeline already for the year ahead nobody can argue that Duvz is carving his pathway into the scene right now through sheer talent, self-belief and hard work.  
												<BR><BR> A producer who's known to synthesize sounds, drums and samples from scratch - Duvz has gone right down the rabbit hole and came back out with a pair of monitors, headphones and a hardrive full of driving fast tempo tracks that compare and surpass some of the best known producers Dublin and Ireland have to offer. 
												<BR><BR> Having already shared the stage with well known acts such as 'SLV (DE)', 'Hybrasil', 'Moduse', 'Andy Barker' (808 State), 'DJ Deece', 'Felix da Housecat', 'Bowsie', 'The Dirtbirdz' as well as hosting weekly DJ shows on both 'Phever' and 'House Tech' in addition to starting his own collective 'Platform' along with having become part of the new 'Flexxxin' team as well as producing - Duvz breathes what he is doing. We don't quite know of anyone working harder in the scene right now.

												<BR>	<b class ="yellowbackground"> How long have you been in the producing game for? </b>
												<BR><BR> I've been producing music seriously since about 2018. I had previously messed about with Ableton Live having done courses with Real Sound Ireland, Sound Training College and two bootcamps with Will Kinsella - one on the basics to Ableton while the other focused mostly on Mixing & Mastering. In 2019, having won the 'Soma x Splice Producer Challenge' I took part in another 6 month mentorship program with Will. This really had a big influence on me with how I make tracks and seriously helped raise the level of quality in my productions. Will through his Elevator Program along with all the help and tips he's given me has naturally become a big influence - not only musically but with insight into the business side of things too. 
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Other than Will, where else do you draw motivation and influence from? </b>
												<BR><BR> I draw a lot of influence from EBM (Electronic Body Music) acts like 'Kraftwerk, Nitzer Ebb, Schwefelgelb, Inhalt Der Nacht' as much as I do from Techno acts such as the infamous 'Slam', 'Surgeon', 'Jeff Mills' and 'Cleric'. I think 'Slam' would have the biggest influence on me overall. I think these influences are really starting to shine through in my productions and now I'm finally beginning to enjoy hearing my own tracks a little more (after a break from them once mastered) - which is a great feeling after all the work thats gone in to get to where I am. Although still by the time tracks are finished and mastered I can get a bit fed up of listening to them. After a while that always goes away especially when you get good feedback on a track like what happened with "Rave Is Peace" that came out on the recent "Social Cleansing" VA Compilation on Platform. This track got a pretty good response and I've heard so much good things back from different people since it came out which is great - its the likes of this feedback which spurs me on to make more.

												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> You mentioned EBM - </b>
												<BR><BR> Just going back to my productions - what made me start wanting to experiment  with bringing EBM elements into my tracks was that not many producers in Dublin seem to be doing it. I've seen promoters bringing over EBM or EBM Techno acts like 'Schwefelgelb' and 'Inhalt Der Nacht' as well as others which are doing well but not many other Irish producers seem to be putting out anything EBM infused at the moment. Its a sound and genre that I really enjoy listening to and playing in my sets - so I had to give it a go.
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> What drives you to keep on producing? </b>
												<BR><BR> It's a great feeling knowing other people enjoy the outcome of your work especially after the amount of hours you spend making it - it makes it all more worth while. I think this response from people and from milestones like winning the competition with 'Soma' have probably been the biggest motivators for me to really go for it. These achievements give me confidence to push to where I want to be, although it isn't always easy to see. Sometimes you wonder why do I even bother - but thinking of what I have already achieved and hearing the positive feedback coming at you is definitely a massive help. At times I find I do need to take a break away from producing and just spend time with certain people close to me while focusing on other things in my life that I enjoy. After a few days or even weeks I'll be right back to it with new ideas. 
												<BR><BR> <b class ="yellowbackground"> Have you anything in the pipeline this year? </b>
												<BR><BR> We have 'Endlec' & 'Ã”neyra' coming back to Dublin on February 15th with my partner 'Riipley' on support. We also have a few others lined up which I can't say too much about just yet. I am also joining up with another collective named 'Flexxxin' with the first night of that coming up soon which I'll be playing at.
